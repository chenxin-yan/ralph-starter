# Progress Log

<!--
This file tracks the progress of your project. The AI agent appends entries after completing each task.

## Format

Each entry should be separated by "---" and include:

- Task: The task description from prd.json
- Completed: What was accomplished
- Files Changed: List of modified files
- Decisions: Key architectural or implementation decisions
- Notes for Next Agent: Context for future iterations

## Rules

- APPEND ONLY: Never modify or delete previous entries
- Each new entry starts with "---" separator
- Be specific about what was done and why
- Leave helpful context for future iterations
